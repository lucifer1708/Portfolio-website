      <description>For my own usage, I created Archfire, a custom distribution based on Archlinux. It comes with the pre-installed and pre-configured XFCE desktop environment. It provides the Calamares installer, which makes installing Arch Linux simple. Due to already installed drivers, it is already compatible with PCs that use Nvidia graphics. It includes my unique dotfiles for Neovim, Ranger, and Acritty.

Future goals: Adding multiple Desktop environments. Adding support for multiple hardwares.</description>

      <description>Go is an open-source, statically typed programming language designed to build scalable, secure, easy-to-use systems. Given that Go Lang was created by Google, Google Go is another moniker for it. It was developed to fill the gap between Java and C++ to provide code that is easy to understand, maintain, and execute without degrading. Go is a compiled language with features that are comparable to those of C and C++ and share the same initial main function.</description>
