      <description>Archfire is an archlinux based custom distribution for my personal use. It comes with XFCE desktop environment pre-installed &amp;amp; pre-configured within it. It is packed with Calamares installer to make installation of arch linux an easy task. It is already compatible with Nvidia graphics based systems because drivers are already has been setted up. It comes with my personal dotfiles of Neovim, Ranger, alacritty.

      <description>Go is an open-source, statically typed programming language designed to build scalable, secure, easy-to-use systems. Given that Go Lang was created by Google, Google Go is another moniker for it. It was developed to fill the gap between Java and C++ to provide code that is easy to understand, maintain, and execute without degrading. Go is a compiled language with features that are comparable to those of C and C++ and share the same initial main function.</description>
