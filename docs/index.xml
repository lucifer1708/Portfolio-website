      <description>What are microservices? The term &amp;ldquo;microservice&amp;rdquo; refers to a method of software development in which a large application is broken down into a set of smaller services that each operate in their own process and communicate with one another through application programming interfaces. Each microservice in an application is in charge of a single business function and may be built, deployed, and scaled independently. This method facilitates quicker application development and deployment in addition to increased adaptability, scalability, and resilience in complex applications.</description>

      <description>Why Go? Go is regarded to be a strong option for backend development for a number of reasons.
Performance: Since Go is a compiled language, the resultant binary code is quick and efficient. Go was developed with performance in mind, making it an excellent option for creating high-performance backend systems.
Concurrency: Go&amp;rsquo;s built-in concurrency support enables developers to design code that is both efficient and scalable. Concurrent programming is vital for constructing contemporary backend systems, and goroutines and channels facilitate their creation.</description>

      <description>For my own usage, I created Archfire, a custom distribution based on Arch Linux. It comes with the pre-installed and pre-configured XFCE desktop environment. It provides the Calamares installer, which makes installing Arch Linux simple. Due to already installed drivers, it is already compatible with PCs that use Nvidia graphics. It includes my unique dotfiles for Neovim, Ranger, and Alacritty.
Download Archfire
Future goals: Adding multiple Desktop environments. Adding support for multiple hardwares.</description>

      <description>Go is an open-source, statically typed programming language designed to build scalable, secure, easy-to-use systems. Given that Go Lang was created by Google, Google Go is another moniker for it. It was developed to fill the gap between Java and C++ to provide code that is easy to understand, maintain, and execute without degrading. Go is a compiled language with features that are comparable to those of C and C++ and share the same initial main function.</description>
