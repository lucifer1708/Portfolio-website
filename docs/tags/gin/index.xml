      <description>Why Go? Go is regarded to be a strong option for backend development for a number of reasons.
Performance: Since Go is a compiled language, the resultant binary code is quick and efficient. Go was developed with performance in mind, making it an excellent option for creating high-performance backend systems.
Concurrency: Go&amp;rsquo;s built-in concurrency support enables developers to design code that is both efficient and scalable. Concurrent programming is vital for constructing contemporary backend systems, and goroutines and channels facilitate their creation.</description>
