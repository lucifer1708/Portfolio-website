      <description>What are microservices? The term &amp;ldquo;microservice&amp;rdquo; refers to a method of software development in which a large application is broken down into a set of smaller services that each operate in their own process and communicate with one another through application programming interfaces. Each microservice in an application is in charge of a single business function and may be built, deployed, and scaled independently. This method facilitates quicker application development and deployment in addition to increased adaptability, scalability, and resilience in complex applications.</description>
