## Why Go?
Go is regarded to be a strong option for backend development for a number of reasons.

1. **Performance**: Since Go is a compiled language, the resultant binary code is quick and efficient. Go was developed with performance in mind, making it an excellent option for creating high-performance backend systems.

2. **Concurrency**: Go's built-in concurrency support enables developers to design code that is both efficient and scalable. Concurrent programming is vital for constructing contemporary backend systems, and goroutines and channels facilitate their creation.


3. **Simple Syntax**: Go's straightforward and easy-to-learn syntax makes it an excellent option for developers who want to construct backend systems fast without spending too much time on language complexities.


4. **Huge developer community**: Since Go has a big and active developer community, there are several tools and libraries accessible for backend development. This also indicates that it is simple to obtain assistance and support when required.


5. **Scalability**: Since Go is meant to be scalable, it is an excellent option for developing large-scale backend systems. Go's built-in concurrency capabilities make it simple to develop scalable programmes capable of handling enormous volumes of traffic and requests.


> Go's efficiency, parallelism, simplicity, community, and scalability make it an excellent option for backend development.


## What is in this project?
I have developed a Authentication system which is based JWT i.e. Json Web Token. Also it has features to Signup, Login, View Delete and Update Users.
