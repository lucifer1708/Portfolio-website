For my own usage, I created Archfire, a custom distribution based on Arch Linux.
It comes with the pre-installed and pre-configured XFCE desktop environment.
It provides the Calamares installer, which makes installing Arch Linux simple.
Due to already installed drivers, it is already compatible with PCs that use Nvidia graphics.
It includes my unique dotfiles for Neovim, Ranger, and Alacritty.
