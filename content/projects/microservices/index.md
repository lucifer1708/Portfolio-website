## What are microservices?
The term "microservice" refers to a method of software development in which a large application is broken down into a set of smaller services that each operate in their own process and communicate with one another through application programming interfaces.
Each microservice in an application is in charge of a single business function and may be built, deployed, and scaled independently.
This method facilitates quicker application development and deployment in addition to increased adaptability, scalability, and resilience in complex applications.
